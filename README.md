# Python API Challenge

## Description
This project consists of two parts: WeatherPy and VacationPy. 

- WeatherPy analyzes the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API and the citipy library to generate random geographic coordinates and retrieve weather data for each city. The relationship between weather variables (temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed) and latitude is visualized through scatter plots and linear regression analysis.

- VacationPy utilizes the weather data obtained in WeatherPy to plan future vacations. It uses the Geoapify API and the geoviews library to create map visualizations of cities based on weather conditions. Additionally, it identifies hotels near each city using the Geoapify API.

## Files
- `WeatherPy.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python script for WeatherPy.
- `VacationPy.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python script for VacationPy.
- `output_data/`: Folder containing output data files generated by the scripts.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed (Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, Requests, SciPy, etc.).
3. Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap and Geoapify.
4. Create a file named `api_keys.py` in the repository and store your API keys in it.
5. Open and run the `WeatherPy.ipynb` and `VacationPy.ipynb` notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

## Requirements
The requirements for "Part 1: WeatherPy" and "Part 2: VacationPy" are listed in the project instructions.
